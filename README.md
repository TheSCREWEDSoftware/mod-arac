# Usage

- Make a backup of your database before using this module.
- Apply [the SQL query](https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-arac/blob/master/data/sql/db-world/arac.sql) to your `world` database.
- Update your DBC files (client and server) contained in the release, so add [**Patch-A.MPQ**](https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-arac/blob/master/Patch-A.MPQ) to your WoW/Data/ directory and update the DBC files in your server/data/dbc/ directory with the ones contained in [the DBFilesClient directory](https://github.com/heyitsbench/mod-arac/tree/master/patch-contents/DBFilesClient).

# Auto-updater

It is not a requirement to compile this module with the core; the SQL and DBC files are enough on their own. If you wish to have the auto-updater, you would need to add `mod-arac` under your AzerothCore's `modules`. You can read more on the [official page](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/installing-a-module).
